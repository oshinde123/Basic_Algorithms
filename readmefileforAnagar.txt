Steps I followed
1. cloned the repo
2. made a local tracker and pulled all the changes from the the feature branch git checkout -b list_feature origin/list_feature
3. made a venv for downloading the required lib to run the file already present 
4. used .gitignore to have git ignore the venv from tracking 
5. making a visualization function to be used in linear regression, to avoid conflict , will first pull the changes latest changes from feature branch
6. after testing added both the files to staging area, committed the files , pulled from origin then pushed the files.
